Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.
The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.
Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"




    Time Compelixty  : O(n) , n = len of string. 
    Space Cpmplexity : O(n) , n = len of string [ since strings are immuatble in python it need to be converted to list ].
